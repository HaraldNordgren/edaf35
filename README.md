## EDAF35 Project: Currently Heap Managers (Buddy and Linked List)
 
1. Your task is to implement two versions of malloc/calloc/realloc and free.

2. One should be a linked-list implementation and the other an implementation of the buddy system.

3. You must use **sbrk** to allocate memory from the kernel.

4. Your implementations should work with gawk.

5. Download gawk and type configure and make check.

6. Then edit the **Makefile** to use your malloc implementation. To edit the **Makefile**, look for places where **version** is used and add your file in the same way.

7. Then type make check again.

8. Repeat for your other malloc implementation.

9. Show your code to Jonas at one of his office hours.
